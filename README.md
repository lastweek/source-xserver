# X Server

I found these excellent resources aboutr X Server

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_server
2. https://www.x.org/wiki/guide/concepts/
3. Volume One: Xlib Programming Manual http://csweb.cs.wfu.edu/~torgerse/Kokua/Irix_6.5.21_doc_cd/usr/share/Insight/library/SGI_bookshelves/SGI_Developer/books/XLib_PG/sgi_html/index.html
	- I think this is the best one, covered the internal design at a high-level.
	  Others would directly jump to code.
